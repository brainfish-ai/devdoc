title: Authentication
description: Authentication for the Countries GraphQL API
---

The Countries GraphQL API is a **public API** that does not require authentication.

## Public Access

You can make requests to the API without any API keys or tokens:

```bash
curl -X POST https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ countries { name code } }"}'
```

## Rate Limiting

While the API is public, please be mindful of usage:

- Avoid making excessive requests in short periods
- Cache responses when possible
- Use specific queries instead of fetching all data

## CORS

The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing you to make requests directly from web browsers.

## Using with JavaScript

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      query {
        countries {
          name
          code
          capital
        }
      }
    `
  }),
});

const { data } = await response.json();
console.log(data.countries);
```

## GraphQL Clients

For production applications, consider using a GraphQL client library:

- **Apollo Client** - Full-featured GraphQL client for React, Vue, and more
- **urql** - Lightweight and flexible GraphQL client
- **graphql-request** - Minimal GraphQL client for simple requests

<Tip>
  Use the interactive playground above to test queries before integrating them into your application.
