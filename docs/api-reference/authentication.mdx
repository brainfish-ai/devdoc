description: How to authenticate with the DevDoc API
---

All requests to the DevDoc API require authentication using an API key.

## Getting an API Key

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to create an API key is using the DevDoc CLI:

```bash
devdoc keys create --name "My API Key"
```

### Using the Dashboard

1. Log in to your [DevDoc Dashboard](https://app.brainfi.sh)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Copy and store your key securely

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once. Store them securely and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl https://api.devdoc.sh/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

## Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in an environment variable:

```bash
export DEVDOC_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Then use it in your requests:

```bash
curl https://api.devdoc.sh/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEVDOC_API_KEY"
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```

## Key Management

### Listing Keys

```bash
devdoc keys list
```

### Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately:

```bash
devdoc keys revoke <key_id>
```

<Tip>
  Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production) to limit the impact of a compromised key.
