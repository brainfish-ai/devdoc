description: Getting started with the DevDoc API
---

The DevDoc API allows you to programmatically manage your documentation projects, deployments, and API keys.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.devdoc.sh/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.devdoc.sh/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

<Note>
  Generate API keys from your [DevDoc Dashboard](https://app.brainfi.sh) or using the CLI with `devdoc keys create`.
</Note>

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_abc123"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

The API is rate limited to **100 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
