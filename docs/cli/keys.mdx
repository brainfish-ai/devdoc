Manage API keys for authenticating deployments to your DevDoc project.

## Overview

API keys are used to authenticate `devdoc deploy` commands. They are:

- Generated automatically on first deploy
- Stored in `.devdoc.json` (add to `.gitignore`!)
- Required for CI/CD deployments
- Can be regenerated if compromised

## Commands

### List Keys

View your current API key:

```bash
devdoc keys list
```

Output:

```
Project: my-docs-abc123
API Key: sk_live_...789 (created Jan 15, 2026)
```

### Regenerate Key

Generate a new API key (invalidates the old one):

```bash
devdoc keys regenerate
```

Output:

```
⚠️ This will invalidate your current API key.
   Any CI/CD pipelines using the old key will fail.

? Continue? (y/N) y

✓ New API key generated!

  New key: sk_live_newkey123...

  Updated .devdoc.json with new key.

⚠️ Update your CI/CD secrets with this new key.
```

<Warning>
  Regenerating a key immediately invalidates the old one. Update your CI/CD secrets before the next automated deployment.
</Warning>

## Storage

### Local Development

API keys are stored in `.devdoc.json`:

```json
{
  "projectSlug": "my-docs-abc123",
  "apiKey": "sk_live_xyz789..."
}
```

<Note>
  Always add `.devdoc.json` to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing your API key.
</Note>

### CI/CD

For automated deployments, store the API key as a secret:

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
env:
  DEVDOC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEVDOC_API_KEY }}
```

**GitLab CI:**

```yaml
variables:
  DEVDOC_API_KEY: $DEVDOC_API_KEY
```

**Vercel:**

Add `DEVDOC_API_KEY` in Project Settings → Environment Variables.

## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Never commit API keys">
    Add `.devdoc.json` to `.gitignore`:
    
    ```bash
    echo ".devdoc.json" >> .gitignore
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use environment secrets">
    Store keys in your CI/CD platform's secret management, never in code.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rotate keys periodically">
    Regenerate keys every few months or after team member changes:
    
    ```bash
    devdoc keys regenerate
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use separate keys per environment">
    In the future, DevDoc will support multiple keys with different permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Format

DevDoc API keys follow this format:

```
sk_live_<random_string>
```

- `sk_` - Secret key prefix
- `live_` - Environment (live = production)
- `<random_string>` - 32 character random identifier

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

1. Check if the key was regenerated
2. Ensure `.devdoc.json` exists and has the correct key
3. Verify the `DEVDOC_API_KEY` environment variable

```bash
# Check current project
devdoc whoami

# Verify key exists
cat .devdoc.json
```

### "Key not found"

You may not have deployed yet:

```bash
devdoc deploy  # Creates project and generates key
```

### Lost API Key

If you've lost your API key and don't have `.devdoc.json`:

1. Delete the project and create a new one:

```bash
# Contact support to delete the old project
# Then deploy fresh:
devdoc deploy
```

<Tip>
  Future versions will support key recovery via email verification.

## Future Features

Coming soon:

- **Read-only keys** - For CI validation without deploy access
- **Team keys** - Shared keys for team deployments
- **Key expiration** - Auto-expiring keys for contractors
- **Audit logs** - Track which key was used for each deploy
