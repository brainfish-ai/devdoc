title: "Sync Documentation"
description: "Keep documentation in sync with your codebase automatically"
---

Documentation gets outdated as code evolves. DevDoc AI agents can analyze your codebase and documentation to find inconsistencies, then fix them automatically or flag them for review.

## How It Works

The sync process:

1. **Scans documentation** - Extracts documented functions, code examples, versions, and API endpoints
2. **Analyzes codebase** - Checks current source code against what's documented
3. **Generates report** - Categorizes issues by severity
4. **Applies fixes** - Updates docs automatically or flags for review

## Running Sync

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```
    /sync-docs
    ```
    
    For a quick check without changes:
    ```
    /check-docs
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    In Agent mode:
    
    "Check my docs for outdated content"
    
    Or to fix issues:
    
    "Sync documentation with the current codebase"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Sync Report

After running sync, you'll see a report like this:

```
Documentation Sync Report
=========================

Outdated (Breaking Changes)
   docs/api/users.mdx: createUser() signature changed
     Documented: createUser(name: string)
     Current: createUser(data: UserInput)

Outdated (Minor Changes)  
   docs/quickstart.mdx: Package version outdated
     Documented: v1.2.0
     Current: v1.5.0

Missing Documentation
   src/utils/validator.ts - New export, not documented
   POST /api/v2/webhooks - New endpoint, not documented

Up to Date
   docs/guides/authentication.mdx
   docs/components/button.mdx
   ... (15 more files)
```

## What Gets Checked

| Check | What It Looks For |
|-------|-------------------|
| Function signatures | Parameters, return types changed |
| Code examples | Imports that no longer exist |
| Version numbers | Package versions in docs vs package.json |
| API endpoints | Routes that were added/removed |
| Component props | TypeScript interface changes |
| CLI commands | Script changes in package.json |

## Update Options

When issues are found, you can choose:

1. **Auto-fix all** - Update all outdated docs automatically
2. **Interactive** - Review each change before applying
3. **Report only** - Just show the report, don't change anything

## How Updates Are Applied

### Changed Function Signatures

The documented signature is updated to match the current code:

```mdx
// Before (outdated)
createUser(name: string, email: string)

// After (updated)
createUser(data: UserInput)
// Where UserInput = { name: string, email: string, role?: string }
```

### Removed Features

A deprecation warning is added:

```mdx
<Warning>
**Deprecated**: This feature was removed in v2.0. 
See [migration guide](/guides/v2-migration) for alternatives.
</Warning>
```

### New Features

A stub is created for documentation:

```mdx
---
title: "Webhooks"
description: "Configure webhook integrations"
---

{/* TODO: Document webhook functionality added in v1.5 */}

## Health Check

For a quick audit without making changes, use the check command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```
    /check-docs
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    "Run a health check on my documentation"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This checks for:
- Broken internal links
- Missing pages in navigation
- Orphan pages not in navigation
- Code syntax errors
- Outdated imports
- Stale version numbers

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Run sync regularly">
    Run `/sync-docs` after major code changes or before releases to catch outdated content early.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review before auto-fixing">
    For critical documentation, use interactive mode to review each change before applying.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep code examples minimal">
    Smaller code examples are easier to keep in sync. Link to full examples in your repo instead.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use version variables">
    Reference versions from a single source (like package.json) rather than hardcoding throughout docs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## CI/CD Integration

You can run documentation checks in your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-check.yml
name: Docs Check

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx devdoc check
```

<Note>
The `/check-docs` AI command provides more thorough analysis than `devdoc check`, but the CLI command works in CI without AI tools.
