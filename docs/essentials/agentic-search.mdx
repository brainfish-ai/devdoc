DevDoc features Agentic Search — not just a search box, but an intelligent agent that understands your documentation, executes code, and delivers precise answers to user questions.

## What Makes It Different

Traditional documentation search matches keywords. Agentic Search goes further:

| Traditional Search | Agentic Search |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Keyword matching | Semantic understanding |
| Returns document links | Delivers direct answers |
| Static results | Context-aware responses |
| Manual code copying | Live code sandbox |
| Single query | Follow-up conversation |

## Key Capabilities

### Contextual Understanding

Agentic Search understands the meaning behind questions, not just keywords. Ask "how do I authenticate?" and it finds authentication docs even if they use terms like "API keys" or "bearer tokens".

### Code Execution Sandbox

Users can run code examples directly in the search interface. The agent:
- Executes code snippets in a secure sandbox
- Shows real output and results
- Allows modification and re-execution
- Supports multiple languages

### Conversational Follow-ups

Unlike traditional search, users can ask follow-up questions:

```
User: How do I create a user?
Agent: [Shows createUser API with example]

User: What if I need to add custom fields?
Agent: [Shows customFields parameter with example]

User: Can you show me the TypeScript types?
Agent: [Shows UserInput interface]
```

### Source Attribution

Every answer includes links to the source documentation, so users can dive deeper when needed.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User asks a question">
    Natural language query like "How do I set up webhooks?"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent analyzes documentation">
    Searches across all your docs using semantic understanding, not just keywords.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent synthesizes answer">
    Combines relevant information into a clear, direct response with code examples.

## Example Interactions

### API Usage Question

```
User: How do I paginate through users?

Agent: To paginate through users, use the `limit` and `offset` parameters:

    GET /api/users?limit=20&offset=40

This returns users 41-60. You can also use cursor-based pagination 
with the `cursor` parameter for better performance on large datasets.

### Error Troubleshooting

```
User: I'm getting a 401 error on the create endpoint

Agent: A 401 error indicates authentication issues. Check that:

1. Your API key is included in the Authorization header
2. The key has write permissions (not read-only)
3. The key hasn't expired

Here's the correct header format:

    Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxx

```

### Code Generation

```
User: Show me how to upload a file with progress tracking

Agent: Here's a complete example with progress tracking:

    const uploadWithProgress = async (file, onProgress) => {
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('file', file);
      
      return axios.post('/api/upload', formData, {
        onUploadProgress: (e) => {
          const percent = Math.round((e.loaded * 100) / e.total);
          onProgress(percent);
        }
      });
    };
