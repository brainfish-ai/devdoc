When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it also changes the URL path to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

<Note>
  Hash-based redirects (e.g., `/#guides/page/index`) are supported and handled automatically via a query parameter redirect.
</Note>

## Setting Up Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field to your `docs.json` file.

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/source/path",
      "destination": "/destination/path"
    }
  ]
}
```

This permanently redirects `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

## Wildcard Redirects

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` matches `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/beta/:slug*",
      "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Examples

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Source URL</th>
      <th>Destination URL</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>/beta/introduction</td>
      <td>/v2/introduction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/beta/guides/quickstart</td>
      <td>/v2/guides/quickstart</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/beta/api/endpoints</td>
      <td>/v2/api/endpoints</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Partial Wildcard Redirects

Use partial wildcards to match URL segments that start with a specific prefix.

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/articles/concepts-*",
      "destination": "/collections/overview"
    }
  ]
}
```

This matches any URLs with the `/articles/concepts-` path, such as `/articles/concepts-getting-started` and `/articles/concepts-overview`, and redirects them all to `/collections/overview`.

### Preserving Wildcard Values

You can also substitute the captured wildcard value in the destination.

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/old/article-*",
      "destination": "/new/article-*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This redirects `/old/article-123` to `/new/article-123`, preserving the captured value after the prefix.

## Multiple Redirects

Add multiple redirect rules as needed:

```json title="docs.json"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/getting-started",
      "destination": "/quickstart"
    },
    {
      "source": "/api-docs/:slug*",
      "destination": "/api-reference/:slug*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/blog/announcements-*",
      "destination": "/changelog"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Renamed Pages

When you rename a page or change its slug:

```json
{
  "source": "/introduction",
  "destination": "/getting-started"
}
```

### Restructured Sections

When moving pages to a new section:

```json
{
  "source": "/guides/authentication",
  "destination": "/security/authentication"
}
```

### Consolidated Content

When merging multiple pages into one:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/setup/installation",
      "destination": "/quickstart"
    },
    {
      "source": "/setup/configuration",
      "destination": "/quickstart"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Version Migration

When deprecating an old API version:

```json
{
  "source": "/v1/:slug*",
  "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
}
```

## Avoid Infinite Redirects

<Warning>
  Do not create circular redirects where paths redirect back to each other. This will cause infinite redirect loops.
</Warning>

```json title="Bad Example - Infinite Loop"
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/docs/:slug*",
      "destination": "/help/:slug*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/help/:slug*",
      "destination": "/docs/:slug*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Redirect Properties

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Required</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>source</td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>The original URL path to redirect from. Supports wildcards with <code>:slug*</code> or partial wildcards with <code>*</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>destination</td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>The target URL path to redirect to. Can include wildcard placeholders to preserve matched segments.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  All redirects are permanent 301 redirects, which tells search engines to update their index with the new URL.
