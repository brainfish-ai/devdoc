When users navigate to a page that doesn't exist, DevDoc displays a default 404 page. You can customize this page by creating a `404.mdx` file in your docs folder.

## Creating a Custom 404 Page

Create a file named `404.mdx` in your docs root directory:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <File name="404.mdx" comment="Custom 404 page" />
    <File name="docs.json" />
    <File name="index.mdx" />
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

## Basic Example

Here's a simple custom 404 page:

```mdx 404.mdx
---
title: "Page Not Found"
description: "The page you're looking for doesn't exist"
---

# Oops! Page Not Found

We couldn't find the page you were looking for. Here are some helpful links:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book" href="/docs">
    Browse our documentation
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="code" href="/api-reference">
    Explore the API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using Components

You can use any MDX components in your custom 404 page:

```mdx 404.mdx
---
title: "404 - Not Found"
---

<Warning>
  The page you requested could not be found.
</Warning>

## What happened?

The page may have been:
- Moved to a new location
- Renamed
- Deleted

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the URL">
    Make sure the URL is spelled correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Search">
    Try searching for the content you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go Home">
    Return to the documentation homepage.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

## Custom Layout Mode

For full control over the layout, use `mode: custom`:

```mdx 404.mdx
---
title: "Not Found"
mode: custom
hideHeader: true
---

<Section className="min-h-[60vh] flex items-center justify-center">
  <Center>
    <Headline>404</Headline>
    <Tagline>Page not found</Tagline>
    <Description>
      The page you're looking for doesn't exist or has been moved.
    </Description>
    <div className="mt-8">
      <ButtonLink href="/">Back to Home</ButtonLink>
    </div>
  </Center>
</Section>
```

## Frontmatter Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | Page title shown in header |
| `description` | `string` | Description shown below title |
| `mode` | `'default' \| 'wide' \| 'custom'` | Layout mode |
| `hideHeader` | `boolean` | Hide the title/description header |
| `background` | `string` | Custom background color (CSS value) |

## Default Behavior

If no custom `404.mdx` file exists, DevDoc displays a default 404 page with:

- A "Page not found" message
- The URL path that wasn't found
- Navigation buttons: Go back, Go home, and Search

<Note>
  The navigation buttons (Go back, Go home, Search) are always displayed at the bottom of custom 404 pages to ensure users can navigate away.
