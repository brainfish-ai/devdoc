The `llms.txt` file is an industry standard that helps LLMs index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find content relevant to user queries.

## Automatic Generation

Your documentation automatically hosts two files:

- **`/llms.txt`** - An index of all pages with descriptions
- **`/llms-full.txt`** - Complete documentation content in a single file

These files are always up to date and require zero maintenance.

  <Card title="View llms-full.txt" icon="files" href="/llms-full.txt">

## llms.txt Structure

The `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file containing:

- **Site title** as an H1 heading
- **Sections** for each documentation group
- **Links** with descriptions from page frontmatter

### Example

```markdown
# My Documentation

> This file provides an index of documentation pages for LLMs.

## Guides

### Getting Started

- [Welcome](https://example.com/docs/): Welcome to your documentation
- [Quickstart](https://example.com/docs/quickstart): Get started in 5 minutes
- [Development](https://example.com/docs/development): Local development setup

### Essentials

- [Markdown](https://example.com/docs/essentials/markdown): Writing content
- [Code Blocks](https://example.com/docs/essentials/code): Syntax highlighting
```

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation into a single file. This is useful for:

- AI assistants that need full context
- LLM fine-tuning or RAG systems
- Documentation analysis tools

### Example

```markdown
# My Documentation

> This file contains the complete documentation content.

---

## Welcome

## Quickstart

```

## Page Descriptions

Each page's description comes from the `description` field in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
description: "Learn how to set up and configure your project"
---
```

Pages without a description will appear without one in the llms.txt file.

<Tip>
Always add descriptive `description` fields to your frontmatter for better LLM indexing.

## Custom llms.txt

You can optionally create a custom `llms.txt` file in your project root to override the auto-generated version:

```
devdoc-docs/
├── llms.txt        # Custom llms.txt (optional)
├── llms-full.txt   # Custom llms-full.txt (optional)
├── docs.json
└── ...
```
