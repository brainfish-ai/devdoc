## Quick Setup

### 1. Create Changelog Directory

Create a `changelog` folder in your docs:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="your-docs" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="changelog">
      <File name="v2.0.0.mdx" />
      <File name="v1.1.0.mdx" />
      <File name="v1.0.0.mdx" />
    </Folder>
    <File name="docs.json" />
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

### 2. Configure docs.json

Add a Changelog tab to your navigation:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Changelog",
        "type": "changelog",
        "path": "/changelog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Tip>
You can customize the tab name - use "Releases", "What's New", or "Updates" instead of "Changelog".
</Tip>

## Release File Format

Each release is a separate MDX file named with the version number:

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="changelog" defaultOpen>
    <File name="v2.1.0.mdx" />
    <File name="v2.0.0.mdx" />
    <File name="v1.2.0.mdx" />
    <File name="v1.1.0.mdx" />
    <File name="v1.0.0.mdx" />
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

### Frontmatter

Each release file requires frontmatter with version info:

```yaml
---
title: "Version 2.0.0"
description: "Major release with new features and improvements"
date: "2024-01-15"
version: "2.0.0"
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Display title for the release |
| `description` | No | Brief summary of the release |
| `date` | Yes | Release date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `version` | Yes | Semantic version number |

## Writing Release Notes

### Basic Structure

A typical release file includes these sections:

```markdown
## Highlights
Brief overview of the most important changes.

## New Features
### Feature Name
Description of the new feature with details.

## Improvements
- Improved search performance by 50%
- Better error messages
- Updated documentation

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed pagination issues in list views
- Resolved authentication timeout errors

## Breaking Changes
List any breaking changes that require user action.
```

### Using Components

You can use all MDX components in your changelog files:

- **Cards** - Highlight new features with card groups
- **Callouts** - Use Warning for breaking changes, Note for tips
- **Steps** - Guide users through migration steps
- **Code blocks** - Show configuration changes
- **Tables** - Compare old vs new behavior

## Organizing Releases

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for your releases:

- **Major** (2.0.0) - Breaking changes
- **Minor** (1.1.0) - New features, backwards compatible
- **Patch** (1.0.1) - Bug fixes

### Release Categories

Organize your release notes with consistent sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Highlights | Key changes to emphasize |
| New Features | New functionality added |
| Improvements | Enhancements to existing features |
| Bug Fixes | Issues that were resolved |
| Breaking Changes | Changes that require user action |
| Deprecations | Features being phased out |
| Security | Security-related updates |

## Custom Tab Name

Change "Changelog" to something else:

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Releases",
        "type": "changelog",
        "path": "/releases"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or use "What's New":

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "What's New",
        "type": "changelog",
        "path": "/whats-new"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be consistent">
    Use the same section structure for all releases. Follow semantic versioning. Include dates for all releases.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write for your audience">
    Focus on user impact, not technical details. Explain how changes affect workflows. Link to relevant documentation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Highlight important changes">
    Use callouts for breaking changes. Emphasize security updates. Call out deprecations early.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make it scannable">
    Use clear headings. Keep descriptions concise. Use bullet points for lists.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Release

Here's a complete example of a release file:

**File: `changelog/v2.0.0.mdx`**

```yaml
---
title: "Version 2.0.0"
description: "Major release with breaking changes"
date: "2024-01-15"
version: "2.0.0"
---
```

Then add your content with markdown headings, lists, and any MDX components.

## LLM Integration

Changelog entries are automatically included in your `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` files, making your release history accessible to AI assistants.

See [LLMs.txt](/docs/essentials/llms-txt) for more details.
