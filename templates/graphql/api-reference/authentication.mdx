description: How to authenticate with the GraphQL API
---

All requests to the GraphQL API require authentication using an API key.

## Getting an API Key

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key**
4. Copy and securely store your key

<Warning>
  API keys are only shown once. Store them securely and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "{ me { id name } }"}'
```

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive an error response:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid or expired API key",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Missing or invalid API key |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Valid key but insufficient permissions |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Too many requests |

## Scopes and Permissions

API keys can be created with different permission scopes:

- **read** - Query data only
- **write** - Create and update data
- **admin** - Full access including deletions

<Tip>
  Create separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate scopes.
