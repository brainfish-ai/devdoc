description: Getting started with the GraphQL API
---

Welcome to the GraphQL API documentation. This API provides a powerful and flexible way to query and mutate your data.

## Base URL

All GraphQL requests should be sent to:

```
https://api.example.com/graphql
```

## Making Requests

All requests to the GraphQL API must be `POST` requests with a JSON body containing your query:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "{ users { id name } }"}'
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Your requested data
  },
  "errors": [
    // Any errors that occurred (optional)
  ]
}
```

## Rate Limits

The API is rate limited to **1000 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

<Note>
  Use the **GraphQL API** explorer on the right to test queries interactively.
