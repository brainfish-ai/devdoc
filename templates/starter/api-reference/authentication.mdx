description: How to authenticate API requests
---

The API uses API keys for authentication. Include your key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign in to the [Developer Portal](https://dashboard.example.com)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Choose the appropriate scopes
5. Copy and store your key securely

<Warning>
  API keys grant access to your account. Keep them secret and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123..."
```

## Key Types

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Live | `sk_live_` | Production environment |
| Test | `sk_test_` | Sandbox environment |

## Scopes

API keys can have different permission levels:

- **read** - Read-only access to resources
- **write** - Create and update resources
- **delete** - Delete resources
- **admin** - Full administrative access

<Tip>
  Use test keys (`sk_test_`) during development. They work identically but don't affect production data.
</Tip>

## Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:

1. Go to **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. Generate a new key

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated.
