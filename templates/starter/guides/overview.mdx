# Overview

This guide covers the core concepts you need to know to build great documentation.

## Writing Content

All documentation is written in **MDX** - Markdown with JSX support. This means you can use standard Markdown syntax plus custom React components.

### Markdown Basics

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

[Link text](https://example.com)

`inline code`
```

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language highlighting:

```javascript title="example.js"
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```
