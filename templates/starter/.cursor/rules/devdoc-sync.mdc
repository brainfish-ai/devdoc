# Documentation Sync Rules

When asked to sync, update, or check documentation:

## Analysis Process

1. Compare documented APIs against source code exports
2. Verify code examples compile/run correctly
3. Check version numbers match package.json
4. Validate all internal links resolve
5. Identify new features needing documentation

## Common Outdated Patterns

- Function signatures that changed
- Removed or renamed exports
- Changed configuration options
- Updated CLI commands
- New required parameters
- Deprecated features still documented

## Update Guidelines

- Preserve existing explanations and prose
- Only update technical details (code, signatures, versions)
- Add TODO comments for sections needing human review
- Create stubs for undocumented new features
- Mark deprecated features with Warning callout

## Detection Checklist

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| Function exists | Search source for export |
| Signature matches | Compare params and return type |
| Version current | Check package.json |
| Route exists | Search API routes |
| Component props | Check TypeScript interface |

## Update Patterns

### Changed Signature
Update the documented signature to match source.

### Removed Feature
Add deprecation warning:
```mdx
<Warning>
This feature was removed in vX.X.
</Warning>
```

### New Feature
Create stub with TODO:
```mdx
{/* TODO: Document this feature */}
```

## Report Format

When checking docs, report:
- Outdated items (with specific file:line)
- Missing documentation
- Broken links
- Up-to-date items (summary)
