# Delete Documentation

When asked to delete documentation:

## Step 1: Understand What to Delete

Ask: "What would you like to delete?
1. **A specific page** - Tell me which page(s)
2. **Find unused pages** - I'll identify orphans
3. **Deprecated content** - I'll find deprecated pages
4. **Clean up** - Describe what to remove"

## Step 2: Identify Pages

**For Specific Page:**
- Verify file exists
- Check for incoming links

**For Unused Pages:**
Compare .mdx files vs docs.json:
```
Orphan pages (not in navigation):
- drafts/unused.mdx
- old/deprecated.mdx
```

**For Deprecated:**
Search for deprecation markers in files.

## Step 3: Analyze Impact

Before deletion, check:
- Incoming links from other pages
- Entry in docs.json
- Should redirect to new page?

Show analysis:
```
Deleting `guides/old-feature.mdx`:

Links from:
- quickstart.mdx:45
- api/overview.mdx:23

In docs.json: Yes

Options:
1. Delete and fix links
2. Delete and redirect
3. Delete only
4. Cancel
```

## Step 4: Confirm

"Ready to delete?

This will:
- ❌ Delete the file
- ❌ Remove from docs.json
- ⚠️ Leave broken links (I can fix)

Proceed?"

## Step 5: Execute

**Delete and Fix Links:**
1. Delete file
2. Update docs.json
3. Fix links in other pages

**Delete and Redirect:**
1. Delete file
2. Update docs.json
3. Add redirect rule

**Delete Only:**
1. Delete file
2. Update docs.json
3. Warn about broken links

## Summary

"Deleted:
- ❌ `guides/old-feature.mdx`
- ✓ Removed from navigation
- ✓ Fixed links in 2 pages

Use `/commit-doc` when ready to commit."

## Safety

- Always confirm before deleting
- Check for incoming links
- Offer redirects for public pages
- Never delete docs.json without explicit confirmation
